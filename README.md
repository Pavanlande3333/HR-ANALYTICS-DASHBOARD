# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD

 Developed an HR analytics dashboard to track and analyze employee 
attrition rates across the organization.
• Designed the dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of attrition 
rates by gender, department, total head count, age, and education 
level.
• Conducted data analysis to identify the root causes of attrition and 
develop strategies to reduce attrition rates.
• Worked with HR and business leaders to interpret the data and make 
informed decisions based on the insights provided by the dashboard.
• Presented the dashboard findings to senior leadership to help inform 
business strategy and workforce planning decisions.
• Developed and implemented retention strategies targeting specific 
departments and employee groups identified as having the highest 
attrition rates, resulting in reduced turnover and improved morale.
• Received positive feedback from HR and business leaders on the 
effectiveness of the dashboard in providing data-driven insights and 
facilitating informed decision-making.
